This repository is the first full website I ever implemented by myself when I started coding 4 years ago. I took a course from Coursera and learned all the fundamentals of coding in HTML and created a website that is hosted here. The purpose of creating this repository is to simply share my work and have other people perhaps give pointers. There isn't a business to it, as the website is more of a personal website than a commerical one. This was mostly for educational purposes.
